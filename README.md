Brothers (yes literally brothers) from the same family.

## Story
The central character of our entry is a young but successful python named Django. Django is struggling to maintain his market share in the web framework market. His quest takes him to the deep underground mine where his nemesis Ruby (a walking, talking gemstone) is busy putting rubies on rails for the benefit of his growing empire.

You play the part of Django. Cruise around in a mine cart through the mine collecting rubies and power up quotes from key technology figures to thwart the evil plans of your nemesis. Collect as many rubies as you can while avoiding other carts, enemies and breaks in the track.

Inspired by the "mine cart madness" levels from Donkey Kong Country on SNES.
